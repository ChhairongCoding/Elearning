        <p>
          Our journey started with a simple idea: to create a learning space
          that adapts to the needs of todayâ€™s digital learners. Founded in 2023,
          TEACHCODE has since grown into a global learning platform, connecting
          students and professionals with experts from around the world. We are
          driven by our passion for education and our commitment to innovation,
          constantly enhancing our platform to bring the best learning
          experience to our students.
